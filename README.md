# Planner-
In this project we went and build a planner that would be able to tell us by color codded if we were in the past, present or future. 
Users would be able to write stuff down and be able to save it so that when it gets refreshed it would not be deleted. 
collabed with classmates Shannon Hogeboom and David Flores.
